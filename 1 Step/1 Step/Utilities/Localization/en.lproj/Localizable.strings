Steps on the other hand, are calculated from stepUnits with a specific ratio. This makes sure that independent from your stepUnits, every goal you create will have at least ten steps to take and at most thousand.

Example:
Meditate 3 hours.
This goal would have a ratio of 60, leading to 180 steps to take in total.
Each step would correspond to 1 minute.";
