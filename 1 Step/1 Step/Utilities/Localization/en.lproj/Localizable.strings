The amount of stepUnits correspond to the amount of steps you have to take in order to reach your goal. It is defined by the user.
Steps on the other hand are calculated from stepUnits with a specific ratio. This makes sure that independent from your stepUnits, every goal you create will have at least ten steps to take and at most thousand to take.

Meditate 3 hours.
This goal would have 3 stepUnits and a ratio of 60, leading to 180 steps to take in total.
